# DataTables.NET.MVC
An ASP.NET MVC Razor Wrapper for DataTables

After using DataTables in one of my project build on ASP.NET MVC, Its simple yet rich feature captivate my interest.
Compared to some expensive license component, DataTables is friendlier to developer and highly supported by community.

This is my attemp to make development on ASP.NET MVC yet easier by creating a wrapper.

The concept is you should be able to use the Razor Html Extension to define a DataTables.

@Html.DataTables.TableFor(m => m);
